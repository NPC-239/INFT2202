# INFT2202
For the 4th Semester of Computer Programming - Durham College
What I intend to do with this repository is to fill it with as much of the course work as possible, then make the repository public after this semester (finishing in April).
I want to learn as much about JavaScript during this time and obtain knowledge pertaining to the creation of these programs as necessary and how they interact with web pages.
